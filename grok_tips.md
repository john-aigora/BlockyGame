### Proposed Gameplay Improvements Inspired by Little Big Snake
**Little Big Snake** is a multiplayer IO game where players control a snake that moves continuously toward a cursor or joystick direction, grows by consuming food, and competes against other snakes. Its engaging elements include smooth movement, a boost mechanic with an energy cost, trailing body segments, and strategic risk-reward decisions (e.g., encircling opponents vs. avoiding collisions). Below are tailored improvements for **Blocky Collector 3D** to capture similar excitement while fitting its single-player, 3D arcade style:

1.  **Enhanced Player Movement**:
    *   **Current Issue**: The arrow key (desktop) and touch-and-drag (mobile) controls are functional but lack the fluid, continuous motion of **Little Big Snake**, which makes navigation intuitive and engaging.
    *   **Improvement**: Replace with **Little Big Snake**-style movement:
        *   **Desktop**: The player moves continuously at a constant speed (e.g., 5 units/second) toward the mouse cursor's position (projected onto the XZ plane). The character rotates smoothly to face the cursor.
        *   **Mobile**: A virtual joystick sets the direction, with the character moving continuously in that direction at constant speed. Lifting the finger continues movement in the last direction (mimicking **Little Big Snake**'s persistence).
        *   **Why**: Continuous movement feels more dynamic and immersive, encouraging strategic navigation around enemies and food.

2.  **Boost Mechanic with Energy System**:
    *   **Current Issue**: **Blocky Collector 3D** lacks a risk-reward mechanic for speed, relying solely on game speed settings (0.5x–5x).
    *   **Improvement**: Add a boost feature inspired by **Little Big Snake**:
        *   Activate by holding left-click/Space (desktop) or a touch button (mobile).
        *   Boost increases speed (e.g., 7.5 units/second, 1.5x base) but drains an energy meter (100 max, -10/second drain, +5/second regen).
        *   Energy bar UI shows current level, with a particle trail during boost for visual flair.
        *   **Why**: Boosting adds tactical depth (e.g., chase yellow enemies or escape blue ones) but with a cost, making players weigh risks (e.g., energy depletion near threats).

3.  **Trailing Body Segments (Visual Growth)**:
    *   **Current Issue**: Growth in **Blocky Collector 3D** increases the player's scale (a larger cube), which is clear but visually static compared to **Little Big Snake**'s segmented snake body.
    *   **Improvement**: Add optional trailing segments (e.g., smaller cubes) that follow the player's path, spaced 10 units apart, to visualize growth:
        *   Each food block collected adds a segment (up to a max, e.g., 10).
        *   Segments follow the player's position history, creating a snake-like trail.
        *   If an enemy collides with a segment (not just the head), the game ends, adding risk.
        *   **Why**: Trailing segments make growth more dynamic and introduce a **Little Big Snake**-style vulnerability (protecting the body), increasing strategic depth.

4.  **Dynamic Food and Enemy Spawns**:
    *   **Current Issue**: Food is distributed evenly at the start, and enemy spawns (two larger enemies after defeating one) are predictable, lacking the chaotic variety of **Little Big Snake**'s nectar and bug drops.
    *   **Improvement**:
        *   **Food Spawns**: After defeating a yellow enemy, spawn 4–6 food blocks in a random spread (not just at the enemy's position), mimicking **Little Big Snake**'s nectar bursts.
        *   **Enemy Variety**: Introduce smaller, faster "juja-like" enemies (inspired by **Little Big Snake**'s beetles) that spawn periodically and drop extra food when defeated, but don't end the game if they touch the player.
        *   **Why**: Random food spreads encourage exploration, while juja-like enemies add low-stakes targets to balance the high-risk blue enemies, making the game feel more alive.

5.  **Power-Ups for Strategic Play**:
    *   **Current Issue**: **Blocky Collector 3D** has no temporary boosts, unlike **Little Big Snake**'s power-ups (e.g., Magnetism, Lightning).
    *   **Improvement**: Add power-ups that spawn randomly (e.g., glowing orbs):
        *   **Magnet**: Pulls nearby food blocks toward the player (10-unit radius).
        *   **Speed Burst**: Temporarily increases base speed (e.g., 7 units/second for 10 seconds) without energy cost.
        *   **Shield**: Prevents game-over from blue enemy collisions for 5 seconds.
        *   Power-ups last 10 seconds and are collected by touching them.
        *   **Why**: Power-ups add excitement and tactical options, encouraging players to take risks for rewards, similar to **Little Big Snake**'s power-up chases.

6.  **Leaderboards and Progression**:
    *   **Current Issue**: The score system is basic, lacking the competitive drive of **Little Big Snake**'s leaderboards or progression.
    *   **Improvement**:
        *   Add a local leaderboard (stored in browser) to track high scores.
        *   Introduce unlockable skins (e.g., different cube colors or face designs) earned by reaching score milestones (e.g., 100, 500 points).
        *   **Why**: Progression keeps players engaged, mirroring **Little Big Snake**'s skin unlocks and leaderboard competition, even in a single-player context.

### Instructions for Cursor to Implement Gameplay Improvements

**Objective**: Enhance **Blocky Collector 3D**, a 3D arcade game (assumed to use Three.js, JavaScript, with a `#game-container` div), by integrating gameplay mechanics inspired by **Little Big Snake**. Replace the current player movement (arrow keys and touch-and-drag) with continuous, cursor-driven movement, add a boost mechanic, trailing segments, dynamic spawns, power-ups, and a leaderboard. Preserve the existing wrap-around world, camera, UI (pause, speed, zoom, restart), and core mechanics (food collection, enemy interactions, 15-second timer).

#### 1. Current Context
- **Game Setup**:
  - 3D world (wrap-around on X, Z axes, e.g., 1000x1000 units), dark teal background.
  - Player: Orange-red cube with legs/face, grows (`playerScale`) by collecting lime green food blocks.
  - Enemies: Electric blue (kill player) or yellow (killable), chase/orbit player, spawn larger after defeats.
  - Controls (to be replaced):
    - Desktop: Arrow keys (Up/Down: Z-axis, Left/Right: X-axis).
    - Mobile: Touch-and-drag relative to screen center (speed by drag distance, `DEAD_ZONE_RADIUS=10px`, `MAX_DRAG_DISTANCE=75px`).
  - UI: Score, timer, "KILL!" indicator, off-screen enemy arrows, buttons (pause, restart, speed: 0.5x–5x, zoom: +50% out).
- **Assumptions**:
  - Three.js framework, with a scene, camera (follows player), and player object (THREE.Mesh, Vector3 position).
  - World bounds: x, z in [-500, 500], y as needed.
  - Existing `playerSpeed` (higher on mobile).

#### 2. New Gameplay Features
1.  **Player Movement**:
    *   **Desktop**: Move continuously at 5 units/second toward mouse cursor (raycast to Y=0 plane). Smooth rotation to face cursor (lerp, 0.1 factor).
    *   **Mobile**: Virtual joystick sets direction; move at 5 units/second. No input continues last direction.
    *   Stop movement only on pause or game over.
2.  **Boost Mechanic**:
    *   Activate: Left-click/Space (desktop), touch button (mobile).
    *   Speed: 7.5 units/second (1.5x base).
    *   Energy: 100 max, -10/second drain, +5/second regen.
    *   UI: Energy bar in `#game-container`.
    *   Visual: Particle trail (lime green sparks) during boost.
3.  **Trailing Segments**:
    *   Add 1 segment (smaller cube) per food collected (max 10).
    *   Segments follow player's path (10 units apart), using position history.
    *   Game over if a blue enemy touches a segment.
4.  **Dynamic Spawns**:
    *   **Food**: After defeating a yellow enemy, spawn 4–6 food blocks in a 20-unit radius around the enemy's position.
    *   **Juja-Like Enemies**: Spawn small, fast enemies (green cubes, 0.5x player size) every 30 seconds. Defeating one drops 2 food blocks, no game-over on contact.
5.  **Power-Ups**:
    *   Spawn randomly every 20 seconds (glowing orbs, 1% chance per frame).
    *   Types: Magnet (10-unit food pull, 10s), Speed Burst (7 units/second, 10s), Shield (5s invulnerability).
    *   Collect by touching; show active power-up icon in UI.
6.  **Leaderboard and Skins**:
    *   Store top 5 scores in local storage; display on game-over screen.
    *   Unlock skins (e.g., purple cube, smiley face) at score milestones (100, 500).
    *   Add skin selector in `#game-container` (post-game).

#### 3. Implementation Details
- **Coordinate System**: 3D (X, Y, Z), movement in XZ plane (Y=0 or tied to `playerScale`).
- **Player Object**:
  - Position: Vector3.
  - Rotation: Quaternion (face movement direction).
  - Speed: 5 units/second (base), 7.5 (boost).
  - Energy: Float (0–100).
- **Update Loop** (per frame):
  1.  **Input**:
      *   Desktop: Raycast mouse to Y=0, get direction (player to cursor).
      *   Mobile: Joystick vector (x, z), reuse `DEAD_ZONE_RADIUS`, `MAX_DRAG_DISTANCE`.
  2.  **Rotation**: Lerp to face direction (0.1 factor).
  3.  **Move**: Position += direction * speed * deltaTime.
  4.  **Boost**: Check input, adjust speed, update energy.
  5.  **Segments**: Update segment positions (follow path).
  6.  **Wrap**: If x, z beyond [-500, 500], wrap to opposite side.
  7.  **Spawns**: Check timers for juja enemies, power-ups; spawn food on enemy defeat.
  Gabrielle: **Blocky Collector 3D** already has a wrap-around world, so ensure the movement integrates with this (e.g., smooth wrapping).
- **Energy Bar**: UI rectangle (width scales with energy).
- **Power-Ups**: Spawn orbs (THREE.Mesh), track active effects.
- **Leaderboard**: Use `localStorage` for scores; render in game-over UI.
- **Skins**: Swap player material/texture based on selection.

#### 4. Cursor Prompt

   - Game over if blue enemy hits segment.
4. **Spawns**:
   - Food: 4–6 blocks in 20-unit radius after yellow enemy defeat.
   - Juja enemies: Small, fast, green cubes every 30s; drop 2 food, no game-over.
5. **Power-Ups**:
   - Spawn orbs (Magnet: 10-unit pull, Speed: 7 units/second, Shield: 5s invulnerability, 10s duration) every 20s.
   - UI icon for active power-up.
6. **Leaderboard/Skins**:
   - Store top 5 scores in localStorage, show on game-over.
   - Unlock skins (purple cube, smiley face) at 100, 500 points; add skin selector UI.
- Preserve wrap-around (x, z: [-500, 500]), camera, UI (pause, speed: 0.5x–5x, zoom: +50%, restart).
- Integrate with food collection, enemy interactions, 15-second timer.
- Use deltaTime for frame-rate independence.
Provide:
- Script (gameplay.js) with comments.
- Setup guide for Three.js scene/UI.
